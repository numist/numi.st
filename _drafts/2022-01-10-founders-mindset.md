Some time ago I made a rule for myself that I wouldn't work for a company unless it was still run by its founders. This was partially motivated by my experience at VMware after Diane Greene was replaced[^cliche] by Paul Maritz—the number of people in the org chart between me and the CEO quickly went from four to around a dozen and it was time to go.

Obviously I had amended this rule by 2014 when I came back to Apple[^distance], but fundamentally I still think it's important for an endeavour to be led by people who are intimately familiar with its workings, which Tim absolutely is (and Paul absolutely was not).

<!-- heck arguing that Steve was the right CEO for when Apple was underdog, and Tim is a better CEO for Apple now that it's dominant is a post all its own -->

Anyway, all that is to say that I'm not optimistic (and have a lot of questions!) when a [company starts searching for a new CEO _after_ the existing one has left](https://signal.org/blog/new-year-new-ceo/).

[^cliche]: Replacing the CEO on the first bad earnings call after acquisition is _such_ a cliché
[^distance]: CEO distance of four again
