[Tristan O'Tierney died on February 23rd](https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Square-co-founder-who-created-company-s-first-13655221.php). Heart failure after 35 high-mileage years.

Tristan and I overlapped at Apple in 2007 (he worked on Safari, I was in DT), though we didn't meet until that fall when we both joined VMware. He was with us (in his Mini Cooper) when Vinay crashed his motorcycle [and died](/post/2009/vinay-memorial.html). I was with him when he proposed. He invited me along for the ride when he went to start Square with Jack and Jim,[^1] and I finally joined in 2012. We put him up a couple times when I lived in St. Louis. He [broke my camera](). I gave him his first lens. He proved to have a [breathtaking eye for photos](https://500px.com/p/tristan). He cared deeply about design.

He also struggled. He had substance issues, which is why he only made it to 35, and I feel some guilt that I didn't try harder to help. Tristan had a lot of friends but I suspect he was close with very few, especially by the end—addiction isolates its victims.

I hope he found peace in the end.
