> *gosh* but like we spent hundreds of years looking up at the stars and wondering “is there anybody out there” and hoping and guessing and imagining
>
> because we as a species were so *lonely* and we wanted friends so bad, we wanted to meet other species and we wanted to talk to them and we wanted to learn from them and to stop being the only people in the universe
>
> and we started realizing that things were maybe not going so good for us— we got scared that we were going to blow each other up, we got scared that we were going to break our planet permanently, we got scared that in a hundred years we were all going to be dead and gone and even if there were other people out there, we’d never get to meet them
>
> and then
>
> we built robots?
>
> and we gave them names and we gave them brains made out of silicon and we pretended they were people and we told them _hey you wanna go exploring_, and of course they did, because we had made them in our own image
>
> and maybe in a hundred years we won’t be around any more, maybe yeah the planet will be a mess and we’ll all be dead, and if other people come from the stars we won’t be around to meet them and say _hi! how are you! we’re people, too! you’re not alone any more!_, maybe we’ll be gone
>
> but we built robots, who have beat-up hulls and metal brains, and who have names; and if the other people come and say, _who were these people? what were they like?_
>
> the robots can say, _when they made us, they called us discovery; they called us curiosity; they called us explorer; they called us spirit. they must have thought that was important._
>
> _and they told us to tell you hello._
