title: The Full Wakeman
excerpt: "Get your fucking shit together"
---

Years ago, during a Dames group ride around San Francisco[^sadie], we came upon a _uniquely_ incompetent driver. I don't recall the exact details of what they were(n't) doing, but I _do_ remember Emily crystallizing the moment when she yelled "GET YOUR FUCKING SHIT TOGETHER" through their open window as we passed.

It's objectively the funniest thing I've seen on a motorcycle, but it also cuts deepâ€”helping people with their problems is important, but it's impossible to help someone who isn't ready to receive it.

So if you ever hear me say someone needs to be given "the full Wakeman", that's what I mean.

[^sadie]: Sadie Hawkins, of course
