description: Pardon the cliché, but we're starting over.

My old, bespoke CMS has become quite unwieldy to maintain, and it was never as easy to write posts as I wanted. It came into existence before markup languages like Markdown were ubiquitous, and its overall goals and patterns have (mostly) been achieved by Jekyll and its community.

It's a relief, in a way; I'm far happier using Jekyll than I would have been maintaining my own engine for others. I've been promoted to customer.

I plan to backfill this blog somewhat—adapting old posts for their sentimental value—but the [old site](http://numist.net) is going to rot.
