I've always loved the vibe of classic square-headlight Kawasakis. Nothing wears green better, and this '97-00 ZRX1100 looks especially good with the golden state as a backdrop.

<!-- I was lucky enough to fall into the San Diego Sportbikes meetup group when I started riding. San Diego is a wonderful place to ride a motorcycle and I went on many memorable rides—both daylong and short multidays—with some truly good street riders. -->
