In 2010 my friend Rhiannon invited me to join her and some Caltech friends[^blacker] camping in the desert.

We took a lot of photos but [unfortunately](/post/2025/data-loss/) most of them are gone. This trip was the source for "[science class with numist (aka, what not to do)](IMG_0104.JPG)" from which [this frame](IMG_0104-crop.JPG) of me fleeing multiple burning projectiles remains one of my favourites. Also: my old [gravatar](gravatar.jpeg).

Between the [beer keg half full of gasoline in a pyre](4304991579_33266f8aaf_o.jpg) and the bowling ball mortar I highly recommend going camping with rocket scientists, mechanical engineers, and their hacker friends.

[^blacker]: I later learned that I already knew a couple other [moles](https://blacker.caltech.edu), which is still funny
