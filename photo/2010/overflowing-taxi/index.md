  description: "A Crown Vic wearing black and white United Cab livery with at least five passengers. Possibly an entire bachelorette party? They are drunk. One is waving out an open window and screaming, the one on her lap is blowing me a kiss through the front window. The drivers' face is partially obscured by beads hanging off the mirror and his expression is pretty deadpan, but I like to think that he believes fares like these are what make New Orleans the best place in the world, as long as they don't throw up in his car.",

This one's from the night after megandy's wedding. A bunch of us (including the newlyweds) had retired to a bar and were enjoying a nightcap when the street was flashmobbed by teenagers playing brass. Traffic came to a complete stop as people flowed out of the bars to dance in the streets. Whoever I was next to (I think it was komara?) leaned over to say "I wish I could say this happens all the time here in New Orleans…"

"…so I will."

Because it does. Just the greatest place.[^quote]
