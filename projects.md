# Electronics

As a tinkerer, I like to fix things (or at least learn more about their insides) when they're broken. Like [reviving an electronic keyboard](/post/2022/reviving-a-Yamaha-PSS-A50/) we got for our kid, or [replacing a worn contactor in my electric vehicle charger](/post/2022/contactor-replacement/). Currently I'm [trying to de-WiSA-fy our home theater system](https://xoxo.zone/@numist/110812673720717013).

A long time ago [I turned a Brother SX-4000 into a teletype](http://numist.net/post/2010/project-typewriter.html). Later, [I forced it to print all tweets that mentioned @Square](/post/2013/square-tweetwriter/). Finally, [I shipped it off to Qu√©bec for a new life as art](/post/2015/typewriter-as-art/).

# Fiber Arts

Having a sewing machine is like owning a welder. When Tanya wanted to make her wedding dress, I lobbied for a heavy duty machine so I could make stuff like [better motorcycle tie downs](/post/2022/cargobuckle-mods/). I also turned my high school backback into a hip bag recently but haven't written about it. The search for the perfect hip bag has been somewhat of an albatross for me.

# Two Wheels

A local mechanic and I figured out how to [fit GSX-R cartridges in the forks of a 2nd generation SV650](/post/2010/svforks.html).

I have an ongoing [VFR project](/projects/vfr/).

# Software

There's a [whole page dedicated to smaller bits of code](/code), but I also have some larger ongoing projects that I either help out with or am responsible for, like [feedyour.email](/post/2022/feedyour.email/) (which turns newsletters into RSS feeds) and  [Switch](switch) (a window-based context switcher for macOS). Also, obviously, [this website](/colophon).

# Woodworking

My first significant project with the Shaper Origin was [a media center for my record player](/post/2019/media-center/), followed by a [travel ukulele](/post/2022/travel-uke/) of which I've now made two.
