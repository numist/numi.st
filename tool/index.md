Some in-browser tools I've built to make my life easier. Hopefully they can make yours easier too.

* [Bluey episode filter](/tool/bluey), because my kids pick episodes more or less at random
* [Fixed-point number visualizer](/tool/fixed-point), to help me visualize things when I'm debugging
* [Link to Text Fragment Generator](/tool/link-to-text-fragment), for linking directly to specific text on a page.
* [Symbol Picker](/symbols), for finding special characters on the go.
* [Unicode Fraction Generator](/tool/fractions), originally for making pretty shutter speed values.
