title: Popping Science
---

Calling out untruths is an important part of maintaining the scientific record[^sleep], but this space has a different goal: here I try to share the interesting and nuanced knowledge that's been misinterpreted or oversimplified (and then overshadowed) by pop science and "common" knowledge, with an emphasis on primary sources and—hopefully—a minimum amount of "someone is wrong on the internet".
