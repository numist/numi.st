Hi! I'm [Scott Perry](about), and this is where I write things that I might want to refer to later[^social]. The page I share most often is [What is Modern Monetary Theory?](/post/2022/what-is-mmt/) Despite that, the most popular page is [`<!-- ðŸ¤¦ -->`](/post/2022/facepalm/).

This site is made to be explored[^garden]; if you enjoy it, consider subscribing to the [feed](/feed.xml)â€”you can preview its contents [here](blog). The most recent post is <a  target="_self" href="{{ site.published.first.link | default: site.published.first.url | relative_url }}">{{ site.published.first.title | markdownify | remove: '<p>' | remove: '</p>' | strip }}</a>

By category, you'll find:

* [online tools](tool) I've built to make my life easier
* [things I've learned](ideas) that I needed to share. sometimes this comes from [realizing I've been lied to](/popping-science/)
* [stories](stories) of things that have happened to me (or that I did to myself)
* [code](code) snippets, solutions to small problems I've had and ideas that have struck me
* [projects](projects) throughout their lifecycle
* [stuff I use](iusethis) that makes me happy (or not) in the hopes that it'll make you happy (or not?) too

[^social]: In contrast to [social media](/about/#fn:socials), where I write things that are forgettable
[^garden]: One might charitably call it a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)
