Hi! I'm [Scott Perry](about), and this is where I write things that I might want to refer to later[^social]. One might charitably call this a digital garden, but it's really just an evolution of my `notes/` folder. Markup mixes media and styled text, documents can refer to one another, and web hosting gets it from my computer to your browser, but at the end of the day it's a working repository of my larks and snarks.

The article I reach for the most is [What is Modern Monetary Theory?]({% post_url 2022-08-17-what-is-mmt %}) <!--The most popular page in terms of all-time traffic is [Project Typewriter](TODO).--> You should subscribe to the [feed](/feed.xml) if you'd like to keep up with changes as they happen[^blog].

Broadly categorized, I enjoy writing about:

* [ideas](ideas)
* [stories](stories), including travel
* [code](code) to share solutions to problems I've had and ideas that have struck me
* [projects](projects) throughout their lifecycle
* [stuff I use](iusethis) that makes me happy (or not) in the hopes that it'll make you happy too

[^social]: In contrast to social media, where I write things that are forgettable
[^blog]: You can browse it [here](blog) if you're bored/a webcrawler
