While writing I'll often find myself wanting to link to specific parts of other pages.

Linking to text fragments [is a thing](https://wicg.github.io/scroll-to-text-fragment/), but I can never remember the syntax and I haven't had any luck with the browser extensions I've tried. So I built [a tool](/tool/link-to-text-fragment) to generate them more easily.
