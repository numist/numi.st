* this unordered seed list will be replaced by toc as unordered list
{:toc}

## Jekyll

* A plugin providing support for [Graphviz]({% post_url 2023-03-17-graphviz %})
* A [page](https://numist.github.io/highlight-css/) hosting various code highlighting themes[^highlight]

## Objective-C

* [`defer` for Objective-C]({% post_url 2022-01-08-objc-defer %})

## Swift

* [`.onLazyHover`]({% post_url 2022-12-10-onLazyHover %}), for when [`.onHover`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/onhover(perform:)) is too eager

## Web

* Some [CSS and JS for decorating external links](/colophon/external-links) on a page.
