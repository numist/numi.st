Gists are nice, but I prefer self-hosting since it allows me to tell a story alongside the code.

Agnostic:

* [More humane time intervals](/post/2023/non-linear-time/)

By language/platform:

* this unordered seed list will be replaced by toc as unordered list
{:toc}

## Git

* [Git diff support for plists](https://xoxo.zone/@numist/111747541251099631)
* [Git diff support for SQLite databases](https://xoxo.zone/@numist/111747357265896352)
* [Better diff hunk headers with Swift](https://juripakaste.fi/swift-git-attributes/)[^juripakaste]

## Jekyll

* A plugin providing support for [Graphviz]({% post_url 2023-03-17-graphviz %})
* A [page](https://numist.github.io/highlight-css/) hosting various code highlighting themes[^highlight]

## Objective-C

* [`defer` for Objective-C]({% post_url 2022-01-08-objc-defer %})

## Swift

* [`.onLazyHover`]({% post_url 2022-12-10-onLazyHover %}), for when [`.onHover`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/onhover(perform:)) is too eager

## Web

* Some [CSS and JS for decorating external links](/colophon/external-links) on a page.
