[Switch](https://github.com/numist/Switch) is a window-based context switcher for macOS that started with [a 2009 blog post complaining about the app-centric context switching of OS X](http://numist.net/post/2009/i-dream-of-switcher.html) and became somewhat of an obsession once I started writing Objective-C vocationally. It's been in development since 2013.

I do still use it, I've got a [rewrite in the works](https://github.com/numist/Switch/pull/139) that uses Swift + SwiftUI that is already significantly better in a lot of ways, but my free time has diminished considerably since taking up employment at the mothership and having two children. Mundane time-consuming tasks like the Sparkle update checklist that used to be a nice way to kill an evening aren't really enjoyable anymore, leading me to consider weird alternatives like publishing updates via `brew`. I should probably still push updates through Sparkle; last time I did someone posted about it, which was nice.
